# 2DRunner
Simple Endless Runner

PLAN PHASE AND DEADLINES

We should consider planned meetings discussing character design, level design, storyboarding, etc.
Can list ideas here in the README.md, but for now let's discuss initial gameplay aspects, and level design. 

THINGS TO CONSIDER
This is our FIRST collaboration project, so the graphics/characters/etc. do NOT have to be well done and thought out. 
We're working our way up to the big stuff, we need to develop consistency. 

ACQUIRING CHARACTERS: WHAT ABOUT BUDGET?
For animation, I was considering working in Spriter, or even using the Unity 2D Animator to streamline the process.
Let's start by quickly using "stick figure" animation so we can get the code work laid out and everything first. 
We can purchase characters from the asset store and animate them ourselves, or we can lay out as I said previously.

DESIGN
For a 2D sidescroller, I'm considering just starting simply with a cityscape and basic platform elements.
